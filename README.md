# Comparing-Baltimore-city-and-Philadelphia-Graduation-rate-and-household-income
As we all know, education is one of the most important factor for a country to develop. It is also the same when comes to a city. Children born in the city usually will have a bigger chance to stay in the city, work in the city and make contribution to the city. So I felt interested to see the education level of the city where we were currently in which is Baltimore. And as a comparison, I chose Philadelphia as it was not far from Baltimore and is also one of the most famous city around the world.<br>
I first investigated the college graduation rate of Baltimore, Philadelphia and the average of the US. It turns out that Philadelphia is better than Baltimore and the average at a rate of 0.3446, while Baltimore is below the 0.3277 average at a rate of 0.2163.<br>
In order to provide a little prove of my thought, I took a look at the household income of the two city. And the result is as predicted that Philadelphia has a higher average household income.<br>
